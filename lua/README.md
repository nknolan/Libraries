# Lua

I'm not going to lie, most of these are for LÖVE.

## Boipushy

Simplifies input handling in LÖVE.

## Classic

A class module for lua. Include classic.lua

## Hump

Has a bunch of utilities for LÖVE:

* gamestate.lua: Easy gamestate management.
* timer.lua: Delayed and time-limited function calls and tweening.
* vector.lua: 2D vector math.
* vector-light.lua: Lightweight 2D vector math (for optimisation purposes - leads to potentially ugly code).
* class.lua: Lightweight object orientation (class or prototype based).
* signal.lua: Simple Signal/Slot (aka. Observer) implementation.
* camera.lua: Move-, zoom- and rotatable camera with camera locking and movement smoothing.
